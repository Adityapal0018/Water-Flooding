I have simulated different injection patterns( 5 spot, 7 spot and 9 spot) to see whcih one is the most efficient. I have added 
all the .Dat files which can be opened on Builder(CMG) and each folder has a Results file which you can open in Reuslts(CMG),
which will show the analysis of each section of the folder .  To understand each portion well, you can read it on my word file.
